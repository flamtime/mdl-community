MuseScore Drumline Community Projects

MuseScore gave us a decent start at a free way to create realistic playback for marching percussion scores. This community is here to push and extend MDL to it's limits in the way the community needs.

Tools, Sounds, and SFZ files are all a part of what we're building and improving. Join us.
